# I Wanna See

I Wanna See is my first rails app and serves as a movie watch list.

In addition to that, movies you enter will be searched in Cuevana, a popular Argentinian streaming website. If the movie is found there, I Wanna See will link to the stream.

## Usage

You can find the demo [here](http://iwannasee.heroku.com)

After creating a user, you can begin adding movies.

For every movie, there's a "seen" button (which will later go to a "watched" list), and a link to the stream.

Additionaly, the data from IMDB is fetched for each movie, which is used to find out the year the movie was released and some other data which has yet to be integrated on the website, such as the movie poster.

You can test using the following: 

>Username: test2
>Password: asdasd
